Problem Statement:

1. Use the given link and locate the bank marketing dataset. Data Set Link

Perform the below operations:

a. Create a visual for representing missing values in the dataset.
Answer-
Bank_data <- read.csv("bank-additional.csv", header= True, sep = ";")
head(Bank_data)
dim(Bank_data)
table(is.na(Bank_data)) # Checking NAs value.

#Converting the 'unknown' value to NAs.
Bank_data[Bank_data == 'unknown'] <- NA

library(VIM)
# For the purpose of visulization as a graph to show NAs.
# Each red line in the plot shows one NA value.
matrixplot(Bank_data)

# For the pupose to give output as a percentage of NAs in the column.
sapply(Bank_data, function(x) (sum(is.na(x))/nrow(Bank_data))*100)


b. Show a distribution of clients based on a job.
Answer-
Bank_data <- read.csv("bank-additional.csv", header= True, sep = ";")
Dist_Bank_data <- table(Bank_data$job)
# Distribution in tabular form
Dist_Bank_data

# distribution in graphical form
title <- barplot(Dist_Bank_data, xlab = "Job", ylab = "Numbers", main = "Clients based on Job",
                 col = grey, las=3)

c. Check whether is there any relation between Job and Marital Status?
Answer-
We take Ho : There is no relation between Job and Marital Status.
# For checking relation between Job and Marital Status we perform chisq test.
chisq.test(Bank_data$job, Bank_data$marital)

# Result
Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  Bank_data$job and Bank_data$marital
X-squared = 395.28, df = 20, p-value < 2.2e-16

# Since the p-value is less than 0.05, there is relation between Job and Marital Status.
# There is association between Job and Marital status at 95% confidence level


d. Check whether is there any association between Job and Education?
Answer-
We take Ho : There is no relation between Job and Education.
# For checking relation between Job and Education we perform chisq test.
chisq.test(Bank_data$job, Bank_data$education)

# Result
	Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  Bank_data$job and Bank_data$education
X-squared = 3429, df = 60, p-value < 2.2e-16

# Since the p-value is less than 0.05, there is relation between Job and Education.
# There is association between Job and Education at 95% confidence level.
